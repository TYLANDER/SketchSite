## Overview

SketchSite is an innovative iOS app that lets you sketch user interface layouts by hand and instantly convert them into structured, code-ready UI descriptions. Using PencilKit for drawing, Vision for shape and text detection, and GPT for code generation, SketchSite bridges the gap between freeform design and real, usable code.

The app features a professional full-screen canvas experience with Instagram-like edge-to-edge layout, intuitive component interaction, and powerful AI-driven code generation capabilities.

---

## Goals
- **Rapid UI Prototyping:** Draw your ideas as rectangles, buttons, nav bars, and moreâ€”SketchSite recognizes and classifies them automatically.
- **AI-Powered Code Generation:** Instantly generate HTML/CSS (or other code) from your sketch, with support for user annotations.
- **Professional Mobile UX:** Full-screen canvas with responsive design optimized for iPhone and iPad.
- **Intuitive Component Interaction:** Touch-first design with drag, resize, and inspection capabilities.
- **No Vendor Lock-in:** 100% Swift, no external UI dependencies, and easy to extend.
